      <section class="container article-content">
        <p>Back in 2013, Sébastien, my brother Romain and I decided to launch a coding school to teach creative and
          entrepreneurially-minded people how to code their own tech products through an <a
            href="https://www.lewagon.com/program"> intensive 9-week bootcamp</a>. At that time, none of us had real
          design or branding skills. My brother was a lawyer. Sébastien and I were both engineers (French engineers, aka
          the worst kind in terms of design background 😬).</p>
        <p>We only knew one thing: we wanted to build a program to teach people the technical skills and tools to bring
          their ideas to life. This program would go far beyond “becoming a full-stack developer” or “learning UX/UI
          Design, HTML, CSS, ruby and Javascript”. For us, these skills were also a prerequisite for anyone who wanted
          to develop tech projects autonomously in their current job, start a freelancing career or launch their own
          startup. And we felt that traditional degrees’ courses were failing to provide students with these new tech
          skills. As we say in French…</p>
        <p>🇫🇷 L’éducation supérieure a “un wagon de retard”…</p>
        <p>An idiom that could be literally translated into: “Higher education has missed the train”. This was the first
          time we thought of the word “wagon” for our brand name. After giving it some more thought, it seemed like a
          cool name for different reasons:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>It points to this idea of a “missing block” or “missing wagon” in the “train of higher education”.</li>
          <li>A wagon is a vehicle that takes a group of people (like a class of students) on a journey to a
            destination. This is exactly what our coding bootcamp is about!</li>
          <li>We didn’t want a brand name using words like “hack”, “code”, “tech”, “app”, etc… For us, code is a means
            to develop products and reach your goals, not an end in itself.</li>
        </ul>
        So, Le Wagon it was! Vive Le Wagon!
        </p>
        <h2>Shipping our first logos 🙈</h2>
        <p>After a few drawings on a sheet of paper with a designer friend Julien, we quickly realized that a wagon is a
          poor design object 😬:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It has no beginning. No end. No movement to it.</li>
          <li>It makes you think about underground, work, mine, gold rush, etc… not exactly the images we had in mind
            for our brand!</li>
        </ul>
